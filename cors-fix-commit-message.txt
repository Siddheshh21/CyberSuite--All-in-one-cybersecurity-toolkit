Fix CORS configuration for Vercel deployment URLs

- Updated CORS configuration to use a dynamic function that allows all Vercel deployment URLs
- Added pattern matching for .vercel.app domains and URLs containing 'cyber-suite' or 'cybersuite'
- Added logging for rejected origins to help with debugging
- Created test script to verify CORS configuration with the specific Vercel deployment URL

This fix addresses the 'Failed to fetch' errors appearing in the Email Breach Checker, Vulnerability Scanner, and Password Analyzer components.
