# CORS Configuration Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem

The frontend components (Email Breach Checker, Vulnerability Scanner, and Password Analyzer) were showing "Failed to fetch" errors in the browser. Looking at the network tab in the browser developer tools, these errors were caused by CORS issues - the backend was rejecting requests from the specific Vercel deployment URL.

## Root Cause

The CORS configuration in `server.js` was using a static list of allowed origins, but Vercel creates unique deployment URLs for each deployment (e.g., `https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurity-toolkit-mtlw9dsjpx.vercel.app`). The specific deployment URL was not included in the allowed origins list.

## Solution

### 1. Dynamic CORS Configuration

Replaced the static list of allowed origins with a dynamic function that:

- Allows all Vercel deployment URLs using pattern matching
- Allows URLs containing 'cyber-suite' or 'cybersuite'
- Logs rejected origins for debugging purposes

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    // Allow requests with no origin (like mobile apps, curl requests)
    if (!origin) return callback(null, true);
    
    // List of allowed origins
    const allowedOrigins = [
      'http://localhost:5174',
      'http://localhost:5173'
    ];
    
    // Check if the origin is in the allowed list
    if (allowedOrigins.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      return callback(null, true);
    }
    
    // Allow all Vercel deployment URLs
    if (origin.match(/https:\/\/.*\.vercel\.app$/) ||
        origin.includes('cyber-suite') ||
        origin.includes('cybersuite')) {
      return callback(null, true);
    }
    
    // Allow the frontend URL from environment variable
    if (process.env.FRONTEND_URL && origin === process.env.FRONTEND_URL) {
      return callback(null, true);
    }
    
    // Log rejected origins for debugging
    console.log('Rejected Origin:', origin);
    callback(null, false);
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 2. Added Request Origin Logging

Added logging of request origins to the health check endpoint for debugging:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Log the origin of the request for debugging
  console.log('Request origin:', req.headers.origin);
  res.send('Cyber Suite backend running');
});
```

### 3. Created Test Script

Created a test script (`test-vercel-cors.js`) to verify the CORS configuration with the specific Vercel deployment URL:

- Tests the backend health check endpoint
- Tests the Password API endpoint
- Tests the Email API endpoint
- Tests the Vulnerability API endpoint

## Deployment

The changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub, which will trigger an automatic deployment to Railway:

```
Commit: Fix CORS configuration for Vercel deployment URLs
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Railway Deployment**: The changes will be automatically deployed to Railway.

2. **Verify the Fix**: Once deployed, refresh the frontend application and check if the "Failed to fetch" errors are resolved.

3. **Clear Browser Cache**: If issues persist, try clearing the browser cache or using incognito mode.

4. **Check Railway Logs**: If issues still persist, check the Railway logs for any rejected origins or other errors.

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Consider using environment variables for all frontend URLs to avoid hardcoding them.

2. **CORS Monitoring**: Implement more comprehensive logging for CORS issues to quickly identify and resolve similar problems in the future.

3. **Frontend Error Handling**: Improve error handling in the frontend components to provide more informative error messages to users when API calls fail.
