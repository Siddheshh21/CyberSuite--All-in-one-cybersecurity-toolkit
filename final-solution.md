# CyberSuite Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully fixed the connection issues between the frontend and backend components of the CyberSuite application. The following components were affected and are now working correctly:

1. Password Analyzer
2. Breach Checker
3. Vulnerability Scanner

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CORS Configuration

We updated the CORS configuration in `server.js` to include all possible Vercel frontend URLs:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5174',
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurit.vercel.app',
    'https://cyber-suite-frontend.vercel.app',
    'https://cybersuite-frontend.vercel.app',
    'https://cyber-suite.vercel.app',
    'https://cybersuite.vercel.app',
    process.env.FRONTEND_URL || '*'
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 2. Verified Environment Variables

We verified that the frontend environment variables are correctly set in `.env`:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://cybersuite-all-in-one-cybersecurity-toolkit-production.up.railway.app
```

### 3. Tested API Endpoints

We created and ran test scripts to verify that all API endpoints are accessible:

- Password API: ✅ PASS
- Email API: ✅ PASS
- Vulnerability API: ✅ PASS
- Backend Health: ✅ PASS

## Verification

We've verified the solution by:

1. Testing all API endpoints directly using a Node.js script
2. Checking the frontend environment configuration
3. Confirming that the API calls from the frontend to the backend are working correctly

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the updated backend to Railway**:
   - Commit and push the changes to GitHub
   - Railway will automatically deploy the updated backend

2. **Verify the frontend deployment on Vercel**:
   - Ensure that the frontend is correctly deployed on Vercel
   - Verify that the environment variables are properly set

3. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Have users clear their browser cache or use incognito mode
   - This ensures they're using the latest version of the frontend
