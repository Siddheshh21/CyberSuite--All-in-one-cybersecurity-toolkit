# Frontend Connection Fix

Based on our testing, we've identified and fixed the following issues:

## 1. CORS Configuration

The backend server has been updated to allow requests from all possible Vercel frontend URLs:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5174',
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurit.vercel.app',
    'https://cyber-suite-frontend.vercel.app',
    'https://cybersuite-frontend.vercel.app',
    'https://cyber-suite.vercel.app',
    'https://cybersuite.vercel.app',
    process.env.FRONTEND_URL || '*'
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

## 2. Environment Variables

The frontend is correctly configured with the Railway backend URL:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://cybersuite-all-in-one-cybersecurity-toolkit-production.up.railway.app
```

## 3. API Connection

We've verified that the backend API is accessible and working correctly. The test script successfully connected to the backend and received a response from the password analysis endpoint.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated backend to Railway**:
   - Commit and push the changes to GitHub
   - Railway will automatically deploy the updated backend

2. **Verify the frontend environment variables on Vercel**:
   - Go to the Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your project settings
   - Check that `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set to `https://cybersuite-all-in-one-cybersecurity-toolkit-production.up.railway.app`

3. **Redeploy the frontend on Vercel**:
   - Trigger a new deployment on Vercel
   - This will ensure the frontend uses the updated environment variables

4. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Have users clear their browser cache or use incognito mode
   - This ensures they're using the latest version of the frontend

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:

1. Check the browser console for any CORS errors
2. Verify that the backend is running and accessible
3. Check that the frontend is using the correct API base URL
4. Try accessing the API directly using the test script or a tool like Postman
