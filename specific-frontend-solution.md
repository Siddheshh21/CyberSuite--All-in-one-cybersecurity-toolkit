# CORS Configuration Fix for Specific Frontend URL

## Problem

The frontend components (Email Breach Checker, Vulnerability Scanner, and Password Analyzer) were showing "Failed to fetch" errors when accessed from the specific frontend URL: `https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurit.vercel.app/`.

## Solution

### 1. Added Specific Frontend URL to Allowed Origins

While our previous CORS configuration was already using pattern matching to allow Vercel deployment URLs, we've now explicitly added the specific frontend URL to the allowed origins list for extra certainty:

```javascript
// List of allowed origins
const allowedOrigins = [
  'http://localhost:5174',
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurit.vercel.app'
];
```

### 2. Created Test Script for Specific Frontend URL

Created a test script (`test-specific-frontend.js`) to verify the CORS configuration with the specific frontend URL:

- Tests the backend health check endpoint
- Tests the Password API endpoint
- Tests the Email API endpoint
- Tests the Vulnerability API endpoint

All tests use the specific frontend URL in the `Origin` header to simulate requests coming from the actual frontend.

## Deployment

The changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub, which will trigger an automatic deployment to Railway:

```
Commit: Add specific frontend URL to CORS configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Railway Deployment**: The changes will be automatically deployed to Railway.

2. **Verify the Fix**: Once deployed, refresh the frontend application at `https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurit.vercel.app/` and check if the "Failed to fetch" errors are resolved.

3. **Clear Browser Cache**: If issues persist, try clearing the browser cache or using incognito mode.

4. **Check Railway Logs**: If issues still persist, check the Railway logs for any rejected origins or other errors.

## Summary

This fix ensures that the specific frontend URL `https://cyber-suite-all-in-one-cybersecurit.vercel.app/` is explicitly allowed in the CORS configuration, which should resolve the "Failed to fetch" errors in the Email Breach Checker, Vulnerability Scanner, and Password Analyzer components.
